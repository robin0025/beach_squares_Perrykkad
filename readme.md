# BEACH TASK
This task was originally uploaded to gitlab for use through the Psychopy Pavlovia online study system as a subcomponent of a self/agency study[1].
Here participants have to work out which of 4 squares are following their movements.

## Code Author
Dr. J. E. Robinson & Dr. K. Perrykkad
- online experiment code (psychopy and psychoJS) code adapted and developed based on matlab code for eye tracking experiment [2] developed by K Perrykkad.

## Note
- PsychoJS version should be set to v2020.2 for proper running of the task.
- In our experience the task has a high rejection rate due to several factors such as subjects' internet connections, please read the main citation[1] for detail on our rejection rates and criteria. Feel free to suggest optimisations that might make, for example, the frame rate more consisent.
